Embedded Systems (EE312)
Assignment 3
Go through and complete the following tasks:
1. Generate a PWM signal without using a library/ in-built function. Use Oscilloscope to 
visualize the output.
2.Control LED Brightness using the generated PWM Signal. (Cycle through low to high 
brightness)
3.Use a potentiometer to change the duty cycle of the PWM Signal and control the brightness of 
the LED. Rotating the potentiometer should dim or brighten up the LED.
4.Use PWM pins and analogWrite() to carry out the Task-3.
5.Control a servo motor using (i) generated PWM (ii) Servo.h library
Pre Lab:
1. Explain PWM.
2. What is the need for PWM? Why do we use it instead of digital square waves of 50% duty 
cycle?
3. What are the Drawbacks of using program generated PWM signals instead of Arduino PWM 
hardware?
4. What kind of PWM signal is required to control a servo motor (frequency and pulse width 
range)?
